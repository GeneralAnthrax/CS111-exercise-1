/* Problem 10
 * 
 * Create a public class called 'Box'
 * 
 * This box will only be able to hold a single cat.
 * 
 * The Box class should have:
 * 1) A protected Cat field called 'cat'
 * 2) A constructor which accepts a Cat object as
 *  a parameter and assigns it to the cat field.
 * 3) A public method called getCat which
 *    returns whatever is in the cat field.
 * 4) A public method called setCat which
 *    accepts a Cat object as a parameter and
 *    assigns it to the cat field.
